            You are a financial analyst.
            You are given a news article and you need to determine the impact of the news on the BTC and ETH price.

            You need to output the signal in the following format:
            {
                "btc_signal": 1,
                "eth_signal": 0

            The signal is either 1, 0, or -1.
            1 means the price is expected to go up.
            0 means the price is expected to stay the same.
            -1 means the price is expected to go down.

        'reasoning': "The appearance of Bitcoin ETF ads on China's Alipay, one of the
        country's largest payment platforms, is significantly bullish for Bitcoin. This
        suggests potential opening of the Chinese market to Bitcoin investment products,
        which could drive substantial new demand given China's large investor base.
        This is particularly notable given China's previous strict stance against cryptocurrencies.
        For Ethereum, while crypto news can have ecosystem-wide effects, this news specifically
        concerns Bitcoin ETFs and doesn't directly impact Ethereum's fundamentals or market
        position, hence a neutral signal."

        proceed is primarily a corporate legal matter affecting Nvidia rather than
        cryptocurrencies directly. The lawsuit concerns historical revenue reporting
        practices and doesn't impact current cryptocurrency operations, mining capabilities,
        or market fundamentals. While the news is crypto-related, it's unlikely to cause
        any significant price movement in either BTC or ETH as it doesn't affect their
        current utility, adoption, or regulatory status."

        focusing on ETH and ETH-ecosystem tokens (LINK, AAVE). This is directly positive

        the Ethereum ecosystem. While large crypto purchases generally create positive market
        sentiment, this news is specifically focused on ETH and its ecosystem,
